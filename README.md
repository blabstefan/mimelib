> A MIME type is a label used to identify a type of data. It is used so software can know how to handle the data.
> It serves the same purpose on the Internet that file extensions do on Microsoft Windows.

`mimelib` aims at working with MIME types easier in Python. The standard library comes with the [mimetypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mimetypes.html)
module. This library builds on top of it and adds more niceties to it, so you're generally happier when working with MIME types today.
